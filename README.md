# Season Display - React 
👉[Demo](https://redwan-react-season.netlify.app/)👈 (Allow access to your location for the app to work)

## What is this project? 🤔
* A simple project which takes the location of the user and determines whether it's summer or winter.

## What I learnt? 👏
1. React Class Components - creating class components using the react syntax, making sure that the class extends React.Component & has a Render() method.
2. Using states - learnt the rules of using states, initialising states, setState() function and calling/passing states in JSX.
3. Geolocation API - getting current location and handling error messages.
4. Component lifecycles - componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. I learnt about componentWillUnmount but never applied it in this project as there was no clean up required for this project.
5. Ternary expressions used in JSX.
6. Making a reusable component for future projects - a loading spinner component was created which can take custom messages from other components via props.

## Technologies used: 🖥
1. React
2. Geolocation API
3. Semantic UI - for CSS
